Hi, I am Christian a PhD student in the field of computer vision in the [Autonmous Vision Group](https://autonomousvision.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} at University of Tübingen.

I am studying 3D representations for **novel view synthesis** and **3D reconstruction**. My ultimate goal is to find a practical representation featuring a **low memory footprint**, that can scale to **large scenes** and that can be **rendered in real-time**. To this end, I am especially interested in investigating and improving emerging representations based on **deep neural networks**.

I did my Bachelor and Master studies in Computer Science at [University of Passau](https://www.uni-passau.de/en/){:target="\_blank"}. Funded by the ERASMUS program I spent one semester abroad in Barcelona at [Polytechnic University of Catalonia](https://www.upc.edu/en){:target="\_blank"} in their Artificial Intelligence program. In April 2020 I joined the [Autonmous Vision Group](https://autonomousvision.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} at  [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/){:target="\_blank"} / [Max-Planck-Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/){:target="\_blank"} headed by [Prof. Dr. Andreas Geiger](https://cvlibs.net/){:target="\_blank"}.
